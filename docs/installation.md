# Installation

Astro Packager can be installed in 2 different ways, from either the Roblox Library [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/9886704573/Astro-Packager), or from a direct download [here](https://github.com/izesw/izesw.github.io/releases/tag/v0.1.0a)

## Getting the Packages ModuleScript

When installed, your plugins folder should have 2 items. The item on top is what you want to click first. Then you should have your module listed in ServerScriptService.
